# Plotting NBA shot charts with python

I've been working a lot with python lately and was curious if I could utilize it to plot basketball shot charts. As usually with all my work, I drew inspiration from **fast.ai** by following their programming style and using tools such as (http://nbdev.fast.ai/)[nbdev] to do so and I have to say I learned a lot during this process. The main purpose behind this library was that, to learn, learn how to create a python module and upload it to pypi, learn how to use matplotlib.... and of course, share that knowledge with you guys. Beyond that, I wanted to create a practical tool the coaches, players, data guys could just use to help prepare the defense by knowing the distances and spots on the court the opponets use more frequently and efficiently. Without further ado, I present to you: **shot-chart**
