# Plotting NBA shot charts with python

I've been working a lot with python lately and was curious if I could use it to plot basketball shot charts. I used [http://nbdev.fast.ai/](nbdev) to create a python module to do so and I have to say I learned a lot while building this. The main purpose behind this library was that, to learn, to learn how to create a python module and upload it to pypi, how to use matplotlib and of course share it with you guys. Beyond that, I wanted to create an easy to use tool the coaches, players, data guys could just use to help prepare the defense by knowing the distances and spots on the court the opponets use more frequently and efficiently. Without further ado, I present to you: **shot-chart**
